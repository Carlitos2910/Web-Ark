It might be the simplest creature on the Island to hunt, and while it only provides a small amount of meat and chitin, an easy meal is always of value on the Island. Unlike nearly every other creature on the Island, Achatina does not defecate normally. Instead, it secretes a thick, sticky substance. Achatina leaves trails of this slime, but the trails are so thin that they crumble to dust quickly.', 'Achatina.png');

While most aggressive theropods are relatively solitary creatures, Allosaurus lives in groups of 3. One Allosaurus is the alpha, while the others are its mates or a beta male. Like humans find value in forming a tribe, the Allosaurus has evolved to hunt in packs. Its saw-shaped teeth leave its prey bleeding and maimed, making escape difficult. Once an Allosaurus slows a creature with its cutting bite, the rest of its pack quickly closes in for the kill.', 'Allosaurus.png');

It must do something beneficial for them since every nearby sea creature defends Ammonitina when it is attacked. What this distinct symbiosis is based on, alas, I have not yet discovered. Ammonitina has also made its way into the deeper parts of many underwater caves. Even within these caves, the creature will draw attention if assaulted, making harvesting its resource-rich shell a tricky proposition, depending on what other dangers may be lurking nearby.', 'Ammonite.png');

Typically found among the deepest, darkest expanses of the ocean, this creature preys on smaller fish while being an excellent source of food for larger predators. Melanocetus has an array of bioluminescent light pods at the end of stalks on its head. Like typical Anglerfish, it primarily uses these to attract smaller creatures and trick them into coming close enough for Melanocetus to consume the prey. This often makes wild Melanocetus itself relatively easy to spot among the briny depths.', 'Angler.png');

I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they are named. Despite not being among the largest of the Island herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it.

If that wasn not enough, I am convinced that some of the caves on the island have actually been dug by Araneomorphus, but this worries me.

I'm not sure how a creature so fearful of the ground can be such a picky eater, but Archaeopteryx only seems to consume certain rare insect matter. The most likely explanation is that it tends to nest in infested trees, stripping them bare of such food sources.", "Archaeopteryx.png");

I don't know if it adapted this stronger neck to deal with the predators on the Island, or if its lineage derives from before the stooped neck became common in carrion-eating birds.

And yet despite being a fast, dangerous dinosaur, Baryonyx almost exclusively consumes fish and other water-dwellers.

Basilosaurus is usually closely followed by other predatory creatures, as its eating habits leave plenty of scraps for scavengers to consume.

Its lengthy tongue allows it to quickly grab prey from afar, killing most insects near instantly and quickly digesting them. It even combines the narcotic chemicals in its mouth with the insects' chitin to create a specialized sticky substance.", "Beelzebufo.png");

Castoroides itself doesn't seem to realize how dangerous the island is.

A memorable scene to stumble upon is a group of Chalicotherium playing. One odd playtime activity for Chalicotherium is hurling large balls of snow or.. mud-rocks(?).. at each other.

It possesses the size and shape of large egg-yolk jellies, the powerful sting of certain box jellies, and the bioluminescence of deep-sea jellies. This all combines to make a dangerous creature that lights up the deepest reaches of the ocean. Cnidaria is not generally aggressive, because it lacks normal perceptive senses. It generally just floats along on the current until something gets close enough to sense, at which point it attacks.

While alone, Compsognathus is not dangerous or aggressive. In larger packs, however, it remembers its underlying carnivorous nature. After a group of Compsognathus grows to a certain size, their pack mentality always seems to embolden them to “attack.” For some reason, Compsognathus is not naturally afraid of humans. Rather, it seems to be quite curious about humans and their instruments of survival. They tend to be drawn toward humans out of this curiosity, and then call their pack mates to help explore their discovery.

Even though Daeodon has as many similarities to modern Hippopotamidae as it does to Suina, I've found that to be a suitable nickname. Daeodon is as mean as it looks, and any survivor who wanders too close will find that out the hard way. As an omnivore with a voracious appetite, Daeodon scavenges, forages, and hunts to survive. It has little qualms when it comes to its diet, and that has helped it thrive on the Island's harsh tundra.

It spends much of its days lazily waiting in the water for prey to walk near. That said, it is not opposed to scurrying onto land and pressing the issue when hungry. A good tactic for escaping many predators is to jump into the water, as most are slow swimmers. This is a bad tactic for escaping a Sarcosuchus, obviously, as they are actually faster in the water than they are on land. Whether in land or water, it utilizes a well-rounded arsenal of attacks to display its prowess as a hunter. If it desires to grab a predator and spin into a death roll, quickly lunge forward for a surprise attack, target a foe directly behind it, its able to do so with extreme ease.", "Sarcosuchus.png");

Rather than simply kill its prey, Pulmonoscorpius gigantus injects its victims with a tranquilizing poison, then eats its unconscious prey alive. This subspecies has a large pair of pincers that seem connected to the same toxin sacs as the tail. I've never seen another scorpion that has this adaptation, but I've never seen another scorpion that's larger than I am, either.", "Scorpion.png");

Fact, Charge light seems to be crucial to its survival. When in its presence, they are strong and aggressive, but without it, they are weaker and quicker to flee. Though distinct from any known species, Chimaeram's appearance is a hideous pastiche of bats and cephalopods, and as an unbiased professional, I have to say: I really hate these bloody things. Honestly.", "Seeker.png");

As with its relatives, it is entirely peaceful, and no threat to survivors. After closer study, by which I mean very scientific bouts of cuddling, I've found that it shares traits with both bovids and cervids. However in the soft glow of its charge light, Microluminis cerynitis always gave me the impression that were it larger, it would be right at home pulling Artemis' chariot.", "Shinehorn.png");

Owls are remarkable creatures, but they're not the type that could survive an extinction level event on their own. Since it never strays from the patch of frozen tundra we encountered, I believe the Obelisk was the key to its survival. Clearly a descendant of modern Strigdae, Bubo shares many traits with its smaller ancestors. For example, it excretes waste in the form of pellets, which make excellent fertilizer, and their large wings let them save energy during long, silent flights. They even hunt in the same way: by diving towards the ground to attack their prey with powerful talons. ", "SnowOwl.png");

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it.", "Spino.png");

This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.", "Stegosaurus.png");
INSERT INTO dinosaurios VALUES(null, "Tapejara", "Tapejara imperator is a marvel to watch in the wild. It has astonishing agility compared to the Island's other flyers thanks in large part to the rudder-like fin that extends from its snout to the back of its skull. Initially, I'd thought the fin was simply composed of keratin, but closer inspection has led me to believe that it is actually some kind of sensory organ. Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable. The creature also makes effective use of razor-sharp claws to latch onto surfaces such as the trunks of tall trees, holding its position indefinitely.", "Tapejara.png");

Phorusrhacidae shows interesting traits related to theropods such as Utahraptor, Carnotaurus, and Tyrannosaurus. It has many similar traits, such as general shape and predator patterns, but its attacks tend towards lightning fast dashes and beak slashes.", "TerrorBird.png");
INSERT INTO dinosaurios VALUES(null, "Therizinosaur", "I'm not entirely sure how Therizinosaurus multiensis stays populated on the Island. It is surprisingly slow for its size, and is a solitary predator (so no pack to back it up). I suppose the fact that its sheer power rivals Tyrannosaurus is the only thing that allows this very aggressive medium-sized predator to thrive. The claws of Therizinosaurus are some of the most versatile biological tools I've encountered, as adept at removing trees and foliage from Therizinosaurus' path as they are at piercing the thick shells and hide of the Island's most defensive creatures if backed into a fight.", "Therizinosaur.png");

Besides the obvious gap in size, most of the differences between Moloch sagittarius and its smaller relative lie in its thorns. Instead of being permanent parts of its skin, Moloch sagittarius' thorns are more like spines or quills that can be removed and regrown. In fact, it is even capable of shooting these spines from its tail as a method of self defense, and examination of these projectiles has revealed that they are coated in a lethal poison.", "ThornyDragon.png");

Its long claws and semi-opposable digits make it an apt climber, a quality that Thylacoleo uses to its advantage while hunting. It clambers up large trees and waits to ambush passing prey by pouncing upon them. When something that large jumps onto a target, the victim becomes stunned and doesn't stand much of a chance. Thylacoleo's most notable fighting quality is its powerful jaws. Once it bites its prey, it locks its jaw in an iron grip that can hold most smaller creatures in place. Thylacoleo then goes on to savage its prey with its sharp claws. If it needs to escape from a fight, Thylacoleo uses its muscular hind legs to jump back to safety among the trees.", "Thylacoleo.png");

This extremely large snake, while being a member of the Titanoboa family, does not constrict its prey as most boas do. I believe this adaptation comes from coexisting with giant insects. However, the Titanoboa's venomous bite is so potent that it is known to paralyze far larger creatures. Titanoboa has developed a strange coexistence with other creatures of the Island's caves. Being immune to knockout poisons, and being unable to pierce the thick chitin of the insects, the species have learned to coexist. They often hunt large prey together.", "Titanoboa.png");

A hive-minded carnivore, Titanomyrma is aggressive on sight to humans and their creature companions. When attacked or threatened, it releases a chemical which alerts all other Titanomyrma in a large range to help fight the aggressor. While small, Titanomyrma remain a threat because of their bite.

Between these plates and its unparalleled size, Titanosaurus is extremely difficult to put down. In addition, Titanosaurus seems outright immune to any sort of narcotic effects. They often inadvertently crush nearby creatures underfoot with every step they take. While most Sauropods ignore non-hostile creatures, Titanosaurs take issue with creatures invading its personal space. This is probably because they aggressively feed off any and all plants they can find. Titanosaurus eats constantly, which certainly helps recover health quickly, even after fighting off numerous carnivores such as Giganotosaurus.", "Titanosaur.png");

Trilobite is not a very good source of food. The creature seems to be made mostly out of internal organs and its protective carapace.

If Troodon's cleverness didn't make it formidable, then its tactics and biology would. It specifically pack-hunts at night when we are most vulnerable, and sees humans as its primary prey. This audacity is made especially dangerous due to its serrated fangs' poison, which drains stamina from any creature, but outright paralyses humans. Thankfully, Troodon is fairly small. Were it larger, it might well have become the dominant creature of its ecosystem.", "Troodon.png");

These large wings are not only ideal for catching air currents over its ocean hunting grounds, but they also let Tropeognathus draft off of other flying creatures by flying behind them. While not the fastest flyer on the Isles, when combined with its remarkable stamina, this makes Tropeognathus well suited for long distance flight. Because it’s on the wing so much, Tropeognathus is best snared by those riding another flier.

Firstly, its grab slowly renders its victim unconscious, so death isn't the only concern. Secondly, its vampiric blood drain instantly revitalizes it, even during combat. Finally, if Tusoteuthis is losing the fight, it sprays a cloud of ink into the surrounding water, blinding its attackers to cover a sneaky escape.", "Tusoteuthis.png");

While said fins are folded inwards, Velonasaurus behaves like your average therapod, attacking with claws and teeth. However, when those fins are spread wide, Velonasaurus can rapidly fire a storm of spines at its prey. However, while in this state, its mobility is greatly hampered and it will eventually wear itself out. Therefore it sometimes prefers to unleash its spines in a single, deadly burst. By spinning around and firing a salvo of spines at the same time, Velonasaurus can defend itself from every angle at once.", "Velonasaur.png");

Despite how powerful Coelodonta are, many tribes still hunt them extensively due to their unique resources. Its horns can ground into a highly arousing powder, and its thick fur can support many insulating outfits, making the Coelodonta in high demand.

There are few wild predators that are able to pack-hunt alongside the generally hostile Carnotaurus, like the Yutyrannus does, with such ease.
