# Web-Ark

This Web-Site has been made as a DAW project with (PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3).
It consists of a web page based on the video game ARK, from the company Studio Wildcard.
Inside it you will be able to find all the files and folders required for the Web-Site.

The main file is the Index, also there are 3 more pages:
  - Maps: There is a carrousel with images of all the maps and button that allows you to see more information about the map.
  - Dinosaurs: There is a small dropdown, with all the dinosaurs of the game. It's connected to a database that allows you to see an image and a description of the dinosaur you have selected.
